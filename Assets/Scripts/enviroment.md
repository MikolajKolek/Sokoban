# Development Enviroment
If you want to set up a development enviroment and see how the code works or build it, you will need [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download "Unity") (version 2019.4.15f1 with the Windows Build Support (IL2CPP) module) and an IDE with C# support. During development we used [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/ "JetBrains Rider") for development and [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/vs/community/ "Visual Studio Community 2019") for documenting, as it has much better support for [C# XML comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/csharp/codedoc "C# XML comments") than Rider. After installing Unity and an IDE of your choice, you just need to download the source code from the [github repository](https://github.com/MikolajKolek/Sokoban "github repository") and open it with Unity.
